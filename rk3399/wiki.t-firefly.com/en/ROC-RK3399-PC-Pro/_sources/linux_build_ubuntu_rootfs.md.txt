Make the root file system

Make your own root file system, depending on the size of your root
file system, and note that the "count" value is modified based on the
size of the "temp" folder:

   dd if=/dev/zero of=linuxroot.img bs=1M count=2048
   sudo mkfs.ext4 linuxroot.img
   mkdir  rootfs
   sudo mount linuxroot.img rootfs/
   sudo cp -rfp temp/*  rootfs/
   sudo umount rootfs/
   e2fsck -p -f linuxroot.img
   resize2fs  -M linuxroot.img

"linuxroot.img" is the final root file system image file.
